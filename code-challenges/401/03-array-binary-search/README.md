# Array Binary Seatch
* Array Binary Search

## Challenge
* Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
### Algorithm
* Given an array of sorted numbers and input, locate and return key
* Run If check to look for same element as input
* If not found then return -1
* If found return the index number
