* Reverse an array!

## Challenge
* Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
### Algorithm
* Input the array of numbers into a for loop counting down from the size of the number of the array
* Push the element in the current count number to the array
* Return the array with the new numbers

### Big O:
- Time: O(N)
- Space: O(1)
